            <p class="tips_introduction">When it comes to travelling, packing the essential travel 
                gears can always be a hassle. There will be times where you think that you have packed
                below your means only to find out that you have exceeded the weight limit in the airport.
                This can lead to incurring baggage fees, which you don't want! So here are some useful tips on
                how to pack lightly:</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3 class="packing_heading">Suitcase</h3>

            </div>
            <p class="tip_1">Packing light has to always start with the type of suitcase you have. A 
                well-known and compact suitcase you'd want to consider using is the Chester Minima 7lbs
                carry-on roller suitcase. This suitcase feels super light on the hands yet offers a lot
                of space with its compartments, to help you keep your luggage organised. For more
                information about the Chester Minima, watch <a id="packinglink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExIFpAe21OM">

                    <img class="clothes" src="img/resources/clothes.jpg" height="200" alt="Picture of Clothes">
            </div>
            <p class="tip_2">When it comes to packing your clothes, you must decide carefully what
                type of clothes you are going to take based on the seasonal weather, and whether you will 
                actually wear that piece of clothing. In order to get as much space as possible, 
                you would also need to make sure that your clothes are folded properly. To find out how 
                to do this, watch this video about <a id="clotheslink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84LtRsstGl8&t=2s">
                how to fold your clothes in a compact way.</a></p>

            </div>
            <p class="tip_3">Packing toiletries is much simpler if there are no toiletries packed, as your 
                hotel should provide most of them to you. However, if you feel that the hotel toiletries may 
                not be up to your standards, then you can only bring toiletries that will actually be used 
                during your trip.</p>

            <p class="tips_introduction">There are possibly thounsands of booking websites on the internet
                when it comes to booking flights and accommodation. The sad truth about this is that not all
                of them offer the most reliable prices. The most trusted websites that are known for 
                providing one of the cheapest prices for flights and accommodation are Sky Scanner and Airbnb.

            </div>
            <p class="tip_1">Skyscanner is a well-known flight booking website that works with many
                travel providers to offer the flight fares. Even if you don't have a particular
                destination in mind, it has a feature called "Everywhere" which displays available
                destinations for the cheapest price and fastest journey time.

            </div>
            <p class="tip_2">Airbnb is a well-known accommodation sharing website that allows people
                to rent out their properties to foreign guests. Many foreign guests love to use Airbnb
                due to the great value for it's price range, especially in locations where the hotel
                across the road would have a substantially higher price.
