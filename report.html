    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <p> Traveller is a travel blog dedicated to students within the age range of 18-25 years. 
    The students should ideally be undergraduate/postgraduate students, who have successfully 
    finished their first semester or summer exam and are now on a long break. They now want to 
    depart on an adventurous and cheap travel holiday to either Europe or Asia. However, they have 
    no idea which country to travel to, how to travel there for the cheapest price, or what to do 
    in that country. Student Traveller aims to provide students with an insight to destinations in 
    Asia and Europe, as those countries tend to be cheap yet provide students with the best experiences. 
    The blog also provides the top experiences from previous students who have visited those countries as 
    well as recommend tourist attractions and excursions. Finally, the blog has a travel resources section 
    that shows students how to backpack lightweight and efficiently, find the best flights and accommodation, 
    and improve their photography. 
    There were many inspirations that allowed me to create this website, one of them being my own experience 
    of going through this as a student. I never knew how to do travelling independently. It was only my trip to 
    China, I realised how much I was inspired to do travelling and create a blog. Another inspiration I got from 
    creating this website is from a YouTuber by the name of BennTK. BennTK is a full-time film maker who gets paid 
    and travels to make content. I would say he has had a great impact on the creation of this website as his videos 
    were truly remarkable, and only made you dream of going on a holiday.</p>

    <h2>Planning</h2> 

    <p>I chose to get started on the research first, before going into the development stage. This allowed me to 
    retrieve as much information as possible. The citation provided below, consists of a lot of useful that I 
    was able to understand in my own words. The inspiration is all that was needed. The plan was to create a 
    home page that merely provides an introduction to the topic of the website. As you go deeper into the website, 
    you start to study more information and get more of an understanding. There are many ways I have ensured 
    accessibility on my website. One way is through the alt tags in the images. This will enable users who cannot view 
    the image, to know what the image is. Another way I have ensure accessibility is through enlarging the text with the
    use of media queries.</p>
    
    There are many ways in which usability has been considered on the website. These include, navigation bar, hyperlink images, 
    footer as well as animated buttons.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>

    <p>One of the three things I had to learn was CSS3, Bootstap 4, and jQuery. Although, I didn’t have much time to implement 
    jQuery, it was still beneficial knowledge that I gained. I managed to learn more about Bootstrap 4 and CSS3 through a 
    youtube video, citation provided below. The code was used as inspiration, however as I got the understanding of the video, 
    I managed to modify it my needs as well as adding my own designs.</p>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2> 
    <p></p>I believe I worked really well in the structure and consistency of the webpages as the interaction was smooth around all 
    different types of platforms. This was due to the advanced CSS media queries that were used. Had I been given more time, 
    I could’ve done much more e.g. implement JavaScript/jQuery. </p>
